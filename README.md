## Integer Comparator :- 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1931d825-f5a2-479a-bb72-fb83369178c2)

Here we have implemented # Comparator class that is actually a interface. 
it will compare 2 arguments o1 and o2 .
if we return a # Positive int then   o2 will come first then 01.
if we return a # Negative int then 01 will come first then 02.
if we return a # zero number that means they both are equal.


then you can have a look in the above image or the file integer_compare.java
