Here we have implemented # Comparator class that is actually a interface. 
it will compare 2 arguments o1 and o2 .
if we return a # Positive int then   o2 will come first then 01.
if we return a # Negative int then 01 will come first then 02.
if we return a # zero number that means they both are equal.


then you can have a look in the above image or the file integer_compare.java 


## String Comparator 

if we pass null it will sort Alphabetical order, 
or we want to  sort based on length then we can do this ->
